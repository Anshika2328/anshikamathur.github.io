#  1. Does Overconfidence Lead to Procrastination?: A Cognitive Reflection Test Experiment
**Supervisor:** [Dr. Punarjit Roychowdhury](https://punarjitroyc.weebly.com)

**Abstract:** Overconfidence and Procrastination, are two vast and distinct areas in the field of Behavioural Economics. This study tries to construct a bridge between both these areas and understand whether an overconfident individual is more likely, less likely or does it have no effect on procrastination of a particular task. Over-confidence among the students has been captured through the Cognitive Reflection Test and self-evaluation methods, followed by observing the identified over-confident students’ behaviour on delaying tasks, hence capturing procrastination among them.

## 2. An Environmental Kuznet’s Curve Analysis for River Economies: A Case Study on Ganga and Yamuna
**Supervisor:** [Dr. Ram Ranjan](https://snu.edu.in/faculty/ram-ranjan/) | Co-author: Manya Pahwa

**Abstract:** The Environmental Kuznets Curve suggests an inverted U-shaped relationship between the level of pollutants in the environment and the level of income. This study, by employing a panel data set for a total of 8 states, through which Ganga and Yamuna flow, tries to establish EKC relationships for Fecal Coliform, Bio-chemical Oxygen Demand, Nitrates and Nitrites and Conductivity. The data has been collected over the period 2012-2020 (except for the year 2015). This exercise is done separately for each River Economy. The concerned states are Delhi, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Haryana, West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Jharkhand. Clear, inverted U-shaped curves are estimated for all pollutants for Ganga, but for Yamuna, U-shaped curves are observed in most cases except for fecal coliform. The results for Nitrate-Nitrite and Condictivity have been obtained with relative robustness. However, unlike other studies, the results obtained for fecal coliform and biochemical oxygen demand are not robust in this paper.
