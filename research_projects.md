#  Does Overconfidence Lead to Procrastination?: A Cognitive Reflection Test Experiment
**Supervisor:** Dr. Punarjit Roychowdhury
**Abstract:** Overconfidence and Procrastination, are two vast and distinct areas in the field of Behavioural Economics. This study tries to construct a bridge between both these areas and understand whether an overconfident individual is more likely, less likely or does it have no effect on procrastination of a particular task. Over-confidence among the students has been captured through the Cognitive Reflection Test and self-evaluation methods, followed by observing the identified over-confident studentsâ€™ behaviour on delaying tasks, hence capturing procrastination among them.
