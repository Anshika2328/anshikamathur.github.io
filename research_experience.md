# Research Experience

I have been involved in various research projects, focusing on different aspects of macroeconomics and economic growth. My research work includes:

- **Exploring Economic Diversity:** Investigated the role of economic diversity in fostering growth in emerging markets, with a focus on sectoral contributions.
- **Caste Discrimination and Economic Growth:** Conducted an in-depth analysis of caste-based discrimination and its impact on economic growth in India, exploring both historical and contemporary data.
- **Agent-Based Modelling:** Developed an agent-based model to simulate the economic effects of policy changes, focusing on income distribution and market dynamics.

Each project has strengthened my skills in data analysis, model building, and econometric techniques, providing me with a solid foundation for future academic research.
